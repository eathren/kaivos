1. "Bloops and Explosions" (The Juice)
To make the game feel "premium" and satisfying, every interaction needs exaggerated feedback.

The Borer is a Physical Object, not a Sprite:
Screen Shake (Trauma): The Borer should constantly cause minor screen shake when moving/drilling. Big impacts (breaking a hard rock layer, hitting a boss) should jolt the camera hard.
Weight: When the Borer stops, it shouldn't just stop. It should hiss, vent steam, and "settle" with a heavy metallic clank.
Debris: Drilling shouldn't just delete tiles. It should spawn physics-based rock chunks that bounce off the Borer and player ships.
Satisfying Destruction:
Chain Reactions: Enemies in "Hell" should be volatile. Killing one small "bloater" enemy might explode, pushing other enemies into walls or the Borer's grinder.
Gibs: When enemies die, leave permanent splatters or shells on the tunnel floor. This creates a visual history of the run ("We fought a war back there").
2. Team Dynamics (Co-op & Synergy)
Since you want "Team Based," the friction between the Borer (the objective) and the Escorts (the players) is your golden mechanic.

The "Leash" Mechanic:
Make the Borer the only source of safety.
Light: The tunnel is pitch black. The Borer has massive floodlights. Escorts have small flashlights. If you fly too far into the dark, corruption builds up fast.
Ammo/Fuel: Escorts should have small tanks. They must return to dock frequently. This creates a natural "yoyo" rhythm: Sortie -> Unleash Hell -> Panic Retreat -> Dock & Reload.
Docking as a Power Fantasy:
Don't make docking passive. When a player docks, they shouldn't just sit there.
Turret Mode: A docked ship becomes a specialized turret.
Scout Ship docked = Long-range radar/scanner for the team.
Gunship docked = Massive flak cannon controlled by that player.
Miner docked = High-speed resource vacuum.
This makes "retreating" feel like "powering up the mothership" rather than running away.
3. The "Hell Tunnel" (Environment as Enemy)
The tunnel shouldn't just be a hallway; it should be an active antagonist.

The Crush:
The Borer defines the "safe zone." If the Borer stops, the "Hell Wall" behind you creeps closer.
Visual Pressure: The edges of the screen (behind the Borer) should look like they are crumbling or being eaten by darkness.
Environmental Hazards:
Magma Veins: Drilling certain tiles releases lava that flows and damages anything touching it (friend or foe).
Gas Pockets: Drilling a gas pocket releases a cloud that explodes if a player shoots inside it.
4. Progression & "The Run"
The Shop is the Borer:
Between waves or zones, players don't go to a menu. They walk around inside the Borer (or use a UI while docked) to weld new plating onto the Borer itself.
Visual Upgrades: If the team buys "Spiked Armor," show giant spikes welded onto the Borer. If they buy "Overcharged Drill," make the drill glow red hot.
5. A Specific "Fun" Moment to Prototype
Try implementing this specific interaction to test the "fun":

The Jam: The Borer hits a "Hardened Obsidian" layer and stalls. The drill sparks and screeches (audio cue).
The Swarm: Because the Borer stopped, the "Corruption Pressure" spikes. Enemies start pouring from the walls behind the Borer.
The Solution: Players must undock, fly ahead of the Borer to bomb the Obsidian wall manually, while one player stays docked to use the rear turrets to hold back the swarm.
The Release: Once the wall breaks, the Borer surges forward with a massive "CRUNCH," crushing any enemies foolish enough to be in front of it.
Summary Checklist for "Fun"
 Audio: Does the drill sound like it's eating the world?
 Visuals: Do enemies pop like balloons filled with neon slime?
 Co-op: Does the pilot scream at the gunner to "Clear the rear!"?
 Movement: Does the Borer feel unstoppable until it isn't?
